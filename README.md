# WeatherStationOne

This is part of the Weather Station One project, a complete and modular weather station. The design of the system has been driven by a number of requirements:

- collect all common weather channels including temperature, humidity, barometric pressure, rain, wind speed and direction, illumination / sun hours, ground humidity
- modular design allowing one to implement part of it, or extend the range of sensors
- high depth of production; DIY as much as possible
- long range transmission support - with the point of measurement far from home
- integration into a home automation system
- functional, easy to print, and beautiful 3D design
